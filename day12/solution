#SSH into the affected App Server (say stapp01) - From jump host:

ssh tony@stapp01

#Check if Apache is running

sudo systemctl status httpd

#If itâ€™s inactive, start it:

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

#Verify Apache is listening on port 8084

sudo netstat -tulnp | grep httpd

#Check Firewall

sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

# or

sudo iptables -L -n


#If 8084 is blocked, allow it:
#To allow traffic on port 8084:

sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8084 -j ACCEPT

#Save the rule permanently:

sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables

#Then restart:

sudo systemctl restart iptables

#Test Locally - From stapp01 itself:

curl http://localhost:8084

#If you see the HTML output, Apache is fine.
#Double-check /etc/hosts (only if DNS issue suspected)
#On Jump Host, make sure stapp01 resolves correctly:

getent hosts stapp01

#It should return the internal IP of App Server 1.

#Test from Jump Host

curl http://stapp01:8084
