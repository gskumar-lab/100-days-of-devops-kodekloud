xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. 
The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 2.

b. Apache should serve on port 5000.

c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/beta and /home/thor/demo on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that beta should work on the link http://localhost:5000/beta/ and demo should work on link http://localhost:5000/demo/ on the mentioned app server.

d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:5000/beta/ and curl http://localhost:5000/demo/
