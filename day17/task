The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. 
The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:

PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.

a. Create a database user kodekloud_pop and set its password to 8FmzjvFU6S.

b. Create a database kodekloud_db6 and grant full permissions to user kodekloud_pop on this database.

Note: Please do not try to restart PostgreSQL server service.
