#Just press Enter for all prompts (no passphrase).
#Keys are stored in: ~/.ssh/id_rsa (private), ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public).

#Copy public key to each app server’s sudo user

ssh-copy-id tony@<app-server1-hostname>
ssh-copy-id steve@<app-server2-hostname>
ssh-copy-id banner@<app-server3-hostname>

#This command will ask for the password only once (first time), then append thor’s public key into:  /home/<sudo-user>/.ssh/authorized_keys

#Test passwordless SSH from jump host as thor:

ssh tony@<app-server1-hostname>

#It should log in without a password.
